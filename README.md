# Visualising-and-forecasting-stocks-using-Dash

Objective
Here I have created a single-page web application using Dash (a python framework) and some machine learning models which will show company information (logo, registered name and description) and stock plots based on the stock code given by the user. Also the ML model will enable the user to get predicted stock prices for the date inputted by the user.

Project Context
Stock investments provide one of the highest returns in the market. Even though they are volatile in nature, one can visualise share prices and other statistical factors which helps the keen investors carefully decide on which company they want to spend their earnings on.

Developing this simple project idea using the Dash library (of Python), we can make dynamic plots of the financial data of a specific company by using the tabular data provided by yfinance python library. On top of it we can use a machine learning algorithm to predict the upcoming stock prices.
